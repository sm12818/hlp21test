Q1. How many values does the Q1Type type have?
(q1 is a function that must return the answer)

    First: bool
    Second: bool * bool

let q2DemoMatch (y: int) =
    let a = 10
    match y with
    | a when true -> printfn "%d" a
    | _ -> printfn "No match"


(*
Q2. In q2DemoMatch
0 = The No Match case will under some circumstances be evaluated
1 = The No Match case will never be evaluated because "when true" guard makes its case always happen
2 = The No Match case will never be evaluated because the first case pattern matches for all values of y.

Q3. 
Pure functional programs, when compared with object oriented (OO) programs
0 = are easier to test because they do not contain loops
1 = are easier to test because functions do not have side effects
2 = are not always easier to test because OO programs contain objects with embedded state that makes tests more transparent

Q4. 
The two cases of the Discriminated Union type Result<'T1,'T2> type represent:
0 = valid results of Type T1 or nothing
1 = valid results of type T1 and T2, or errors of type string
2 = valid results of type T1 or errors of type T2
3 = valid results of type T1 or errors of type string

(*
Q5.
In otherwise pure F# programs with printf
0 = all functions have no side effects
1 = functions have side effects but the printf side effect is a monad and so pure functional
2 = functions have a possible printf side effect (printing something)

//----------------------------------Q6 --------------------------

let rec q6fun a b =
    let localQ6fun = q6fun
    if a = 0 then 4
    else if a < 0 then
        (*1*) q6fun  (a+1) b
    else if a = 1 then
        (*2*) q6fun (a-1) (b + (*4*) q6fun (a-1) b)
    else  (*8*) localQ6fun (a-1) (b+1)

(*
The recursive function q6fun has 4 recursive calls each tagged (just before the function) with an integer (1,2,4,8).
For each of these recursive calls, determine whetehr the call is tail recursive or not-ntail-recursive.
Add together the numbers next to each tail recusrive call. thus if you think all the calls are 
tail recursive you get 15. If you think no calls are tail recursive you get 0.
Return your sum as the value of q6()

Q13. 
    A union-find is a structure for representing disjoint sets.
    It takes the form of a map where each key is either:
     - mapped to itself, in which case it is called "representative member of its class"
     - mapped to a different element, in which case the representative member of its class is
       the representative member of the class of the element it is mapped to.
    For example the following map has two classes, represented by 2 and 3, respectively containing the
    values { 2, 4, 6 } and { 3, 5 }
    2 -> 2
    4 -> 2
    6 -> 4
    3 -> 3
    5 -> 3
    Write a function that takes an union-find map of integers and an integer x, and returns
    - (Some i) if i is the representative member of x's class
    - None if x is not in the map
